I am a software developer based in London, UK with 10 years experience working across Web, iOS and Android.

I have managed teams in e-commerce and built apps that integrate with large existing platforms. As well as building customer facing client code I have also got experience working with backend systems to support those apps.

Over the years I have created apps for clients across a number of industries including Finance, Automotive, Events, Broadcasting and Interior Architecture.
